    """
    Applies a quadratic transformation to the logits based on the
    provided smoothing factors and curves. The transformation is
    centered around the maximum logit value in the batch.
    The transformation involves a quadratic and cubic term, with the
    cubic term controlled by the smoothing curve. The quadratic term is
    scaled by the smoothing factor, and the cubic term is scaled by the
    product of the smoothing factor and the smoothing curve.
    params:
        logits (torch.Tensor): The logits to be transformed.
        smoothing_factors (torch.Tensor): The factors to scale the quadratic
            term in the transformation.
        smoothing_curves (torch.Tensor): The factors to scale the cubic term
            in the transformation.
    returns:
        torch.Tensor: The transformed logits.
